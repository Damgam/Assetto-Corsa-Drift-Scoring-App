# Assetto-Corsa-Drift-Scoring-App
 Drift Scoring available anywhere and anytime.

Installation: Copy the DriftScoring folder into assettocorsa\apps\lua folder.

A relatively simple yet complex app that gives you custom-made drift scoring system, inspired by Need for Speed Underground and CarX Drift, that includes remembering personal best scores for you to challenge yourself, or your friends.

Works in any gamemode, even Online!

If you have any ideas on how the scoring system could be improved, or maybe you have some ideas for new features, suggestions are welcome!

I'm not planning to add any extra scoring for tricks, as these are potentially very hard to set up, but I could try! :)​
